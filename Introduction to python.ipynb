    "- **Easy-to-learn** − Python has few keywords, similarities to the english language, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax .\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easy-to-read** − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easy-to-maintain** − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Free and Open-Source** - Anyone can download it for free and use it for any purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robust Standard Library** − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh. So for few things no need to create our own code rather we can use the libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpreted** − When a programming language is interpreted, it means that the source code is executed line by line, and not all at once. Also no need of compilers, code gets processed at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamically Typed** − No need to declare the type of variable, the type is interpreted at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Portable** − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extendable** − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Databases** − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GUI Programming** − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalable** − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Garbage Collection** − It supports automatic garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High-level Language** − Python is a high-level programming language because we don’t need to remember the system architecture, nor we have to manage the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easy Integration** − It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java."
